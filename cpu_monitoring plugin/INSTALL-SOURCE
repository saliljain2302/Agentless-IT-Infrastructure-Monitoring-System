Installation of plugin (from source code) on MYSQL database server.
First we need to compile and and execute the plugin to generate the object file (.so)

The prerequisite to compile & execute the plugin source file are :-
--> mysql-5.1 or newer
--> Compatible gnu c++ compiler

Compile & Execute the plugin source code .cc file available in current directory using the following command.
g++ -DMYSQL_DYNAMIC_PLUGIN -Wall -shared
 -I /home/salil_jain/mysql-5.6.22/include 
 -I /home/salil_jain/mysql-5.1.22-rc/regex
 -I /home/salil_jain/mysql-5.1.22/sql  
 -o cpu_info.so cpu_info.cc

The generated .so file must be copied to the directory /usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql/plugin .

To install the plugin in running MYSQL server just fire the below command.
INSTALL PLUGIN cpu_info SONAME 'cpu_info.so' ;

To check whether the plugin is installed at server or not use the command
SELECT * from information_schema.plugins;
 
To fire select command on the plugin installed use command
SELECT * from information_schema.cpu_info;
